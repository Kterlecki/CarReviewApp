# CarReviewApp

This repository holds code for a WebApi project that I worked on,
## The Goal was:
- Practise working with WebApi 
- Refactoring
- Unit testing 
- App is connected to SonarCloud for Code Analysis
- Build a Client and Server side WebApi

## Technology used
- .NET
- WEB API
- Xunit
- Moq and FakeItEasy
- SonarCloud
- Entity Framework
- Swagger

## How to use
- You can type `dotnet run` in your terminal to start the application
- To run the server, type `dotnet run` in the src folder
- To run the client type `dotnet run` in the client folder

### Note
- For a visual representation of the Server side, you will need start up Swagger. You can do this by entering your locahost Url into the browser - `https://localhost:0001/swagger/index.html`

## Notes
- Compared Moq and FakeItEasy to see the Pros and Cons of both
- Testing with objects vs creating Mocks
- Used Windows Docs, Tutorials and Articles
